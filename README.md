https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm

### Definition 
Simplex method, Standard technique in linear programming for solving an optimization problem, typically one involving a function and several constraints expressed as inequalities. The inequalities define a polygonal region (see polygon), and the solution is typically at one of the vertices. The simplex method is a systematic procedure for testing the vertices as possible solutions.

### steps
To solve a linear programming model using the Simplex method the following steps are necessary:

- Standard form
- Introducing slack variables
- Creating the tableau
- Pivot variables
- Creating a new tableau
- Checking for optimality
- Identify optimal values
